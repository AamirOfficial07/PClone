# SocialOrchestrator Frontend

This directory is reserved for the Angular SPA described in the Phase 0 document:

- Recommended app name: `social-orchestrator-web`.
- Recommended structure: `src/Client/social-orchestrator-web`.

To scaffold the Angular app locally, run:

```bash
cd src/Client
ng new social-orchestrator-web --routing --style=scss
```

Then update the generated layout to match the design docs (Phase 0 and beyond).
